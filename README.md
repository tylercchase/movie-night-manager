# Movie Night Manager

I help run a movie night for a bunch of friends and taking suggestions, compiling the movies we watched and putting it all together at the end of the year to have people vote on their favorite became a massive chore to do.
I wrote a discord bot to try and help with this issue, but it still only solves part of the problem. The goal of this project is to roll all of that functionality into one thing where planning movies is super easy, and we can easily set up ratings and other features.
